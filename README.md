# C++_Praktikum_TUM
===================
This is a practise for who wants to learn about C++. There are five-days' assignments. The first three days are the practise of basic knowledge of C++. And then we need to control a small moon-rover with the help of C++ in two ways: Keyboard Contorl and Certain Orbits.
For the first three days, there are about 30 assignments and I have written each of them in the description of corresponding cpp. files. You can read them and then do them by yourself and then make a compare with the code I've uploaded (if you want).
For any question, you are welcome to leave a commit here. :D
